## Development

First, ensure that you have a `.env.development.local` (or similar) file with the following credentials:

```
FLASK_APP_URL="http://localhost:5000"
```

Next, `cd` into the `webapp` directory and run the development server:

```bash
$ cd webapp
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
